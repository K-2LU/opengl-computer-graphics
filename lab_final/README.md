#### (if the explanations to the problems are not clear, run the solution programs, it would give you a better understanding)
## Group 0: Scaling on Translation
You have a rectangle, it move left and right. if it moves to te right, it expands by a scale of something(let's say 1.25 on both axis), if it moves to the left, it shrinks by a scale of something(same).

## Group 1: Make a working clock
You are to make a clock that has three arms, for seconds, minutes and hours. The arms should be fully functional. You can manipulate the second's hand by a keypress.

## Group 2: Mirror a circle and rotate 
You have places a circle before a mirror. Like real life the reflection of it should be behind the mirror. Now, you are to move the mirror in a circular motion around the real circle and the reflection should move along with the mirror. You also have to immplement the mirror to be brought near to taken afar from the circle as well.

**Key bindings:**
| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| a | rotate mirror to the  left |
| d | rotate mirror to the right |
| ← ARROW LEFT | move mirror to the left |
| → ARROW RIGHT | move mirror to the right |


## Group 3: Moving triangle
You have a triangle, with three points at *(-3, 0)*, *(3, 0)* and *(0, 5)*. The triangle is initially facing upwards. You have to be able to move the triangle *UP, DOWN, LEFT* and *RIGHT* but before each movement, if the triangle is not facing the direction, it has to rotate to face that direction and on subsequent moves it is allowed to move in that direction.    
For example, if it is facing UP and is commanded to move LEFT, rotate it to face LEFT first, then if commanded to move LEFT again, then it can move to LEFT. This goes for all directions.
